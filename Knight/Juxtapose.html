Laguna Beach, known as an Artist's Colony, was founded on June 29, 1927. Both a Mormon settlement and place for drug experiments, the mixed culture and scenic coastal setting lead it to become a tourist destination. Laguna Beach gained further popularity in the early 2000s with the popular <i>Laguna Beach Show</i> by MTV. Pictured above is the downtown area on Pacific Coast Highway, which includes structures still present today. Some include the White House restaurant and Hotel Laguna.
