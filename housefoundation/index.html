<div class="large-12" style="background-color: #8080FF;"> One of the first things schoolchildren in the U.S. are taught about the nation's first president is that George Washington had false wooden teeth (not to mention the cherry tree). While Washington did have false teeth they weren't made of wood, but rather, hippopotamus ivory, human teeth, animal teeth, gold screws and brass wire. Some historians believe the wooden-teeth rumor came from Washington's love of red wine, which may have caused fractures in his false teeth, making them appear to have a wooden grain, according to KQED. Washington was also an avid dog breeder of hunting hounds, who he would give unique names to, like 'Drunkard' and 'Sweet Lips'</div>

<div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12" style="background-color: #9ACEEB"> The nation's second president, John Adams, was known for a lot of things, specifically his love of his wife Abigail, and his hatred for his once-friend Thomas Jefferson.Adams wrote Abigail more than, 1,100 love letters over the course of their relationship.Meanwhile, the feud between Adams and Jefferson reached new lows during the election of 1800, which pitted the pair against each other in the fight to succeed George Washington. If you think mudslinging is bad now, during the 1800 election, Adams called Jefferson "a mean-spirited, low-lived fellow, the son of a half-breed Indian squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father."In an attack ad, Adams said if Jefferson is elected president, "murder, robbery, rape, adultery, and incest will be openly taught and practiced, the air will be rent with the cries of the distressed, the soil will be soaked with blood and the nation black with crimes."The animosity between the two carried over into Adams' final words on July 4, 1826, which were reported as, "Thomas Jefferson still survives." It turns out, Jefferson had died just five hours before Adams passed, both deaths occurring on the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. </div>
<div class="large-4 medium-4 small-12" style="background-color: #0476D0"> Back when Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were friends, the pair visited the home of William Shakespeare inStratford-upon-Avon, England where they each broke off a piece of one of Shakespeare's chairs as a souvenir.Jefferson loved to read, but hated to speak. At one point, he possessed the largest library of books in the United States. His collection had books that were rare finds even in Jefferson's day. Much of his library was destroyed, but hundreds of books survived and can be seen at an exhibition at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., which is currently the largest library in the world.Jefferson was petrified of public speaking. During his 8-year presidency, he gave two speeches, one per term.Portrait by Rembrandt Peale in 1800. </div>

<div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12" style="background-color: #89CFF0"> Best known for writing the U.S. Constitution, James Madison is also known for being the country's smallest president, standing at 5'4" tall and weighing 100 pounds.During the War of 1812, Madison and his wife Dolley were convinced the American army would defeat the British during a battle that he ordered a huge celebration feast for 40 guests to be prepared at the White House. Madison had sent a little-trained militia against the British, who beat the Americans, causing Madison and Dolley to flee the White House. When the British arrived at the White House, they enjoyed a huge feast before burning the building to the ground.Portrait by John Vanderlyn in 1816 </div>
<div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12" style="background-color: #B0E0E6"> Monroe was known for wearing out-of-date Revolutionary War-style attire, earning him the nickname, "The Cocked Hat."

Monroe presided over the country during the Era of Good Feelings, which was a time of national pride and unity following the War of 1812. Things were so good that Monroe ran unopposed in 1820, easily earning him reelection. George Washington is the only other president to run unopposed.Monroe also died exactly 5 years after Adams and Jefferson died, on July 4, 1831, which was also the 55th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Monroe was NOT related to Marilyn Monroe, who could low-key get it, unlike James. </div>

<div class="grid-x">
<div class="large-4 medium-4 small-12" style="background-color: #87CEEB"> The son of the nation's second president, John Quincy Adams is perhaps best known for successfully arguing a case before the Supreme Court which freed Africans who had rebelled on the slave ship Amistad. The event was depicted in Steven Spielberg's 1997 film "Amistad."

Less known, Adams had a unique morning routine. He would walk two miles to the Potomac River, where he would go skinny dipping. After finding out about his routine, a reporter once sat on Adams' clothes until the president granted her request for an interview. </div>
<div class="large-4 medium-4 small-12" style= "background-color: #7DF9FF"> Andrew Jackson was such a unique and eclectic president, it's difficult to narrow down all of the interesting facts about him.

Known for his penchant for fighting, Jackson was involved in more than 100 duels, typically after someone insulted his wife. Jackson survived multiple gunshot wounds throughout the course of this dueling.

Jackson also had a pet parrot, which he taught to curse. The language was so bad, the parrot had to be removed during Jackson's funeral because it was swearing too much </div>

<div class="large-4 medium-4 small-12" style ="background-color: #AEC6CF"> Martin Van Buren was the first president born in the United States after it became a country in 1776.

Van Buren also had many nicknames, including one that gives us the common word today "OK."

He was called "Sly Fox" because of his political efforts, "Little Magician" because of his height (5'6") but it's the nickname "Old Kinderhook" that gives us the phrase "OK" today. Van Buren was from Kinderhook, N.Y. During his 1840 presidential campaign, supporters held signs abbreviating "Old Kinderhook" as "OK." OK quickly came to be used as a word of approval around this time. </div>

	<div class="large-3 medium-6 small-12" style ="background-color: #475877"> HOTTIE ALERT! William Henry Harrison is arguably best known for being president for just 33 days. Harrison gave the longest inauguration speech in history (8,445 words) on a cold, wet day. He quickly fell ill and died just 33 days into his presidency.

Like Van Buren, Harrison is also known as the origin of a phrase still in use today: "Keep the ball rolling." Harrison campaigned with a giant ball affixed with campaign slogans. The ball "kept rolling" into Harrison's presidency. The same stunt was used by one of Harrison's 25 grandchildren, Benjamin Harrison when he successfully campaigned for president in 1888. </div>
<div class="large-3 medium-6 small-12" style="background-color: #0ABAB5" > John Tyler, who was born in 1790 and served as president from 1841-45, has a grandson who is still alive today. Harrison Ruffin Tyler, born in 1928, is 92 years old as of 2021.

Harrison's death led to confusion surrounding who should be the successor. This led to the 25th Amendment which clarified the vice president is second in line for the presidency. It didn't take long for Tyler to fall out of favor with just about everyone. He was kicked out of his own party, all but one of his Cabinet members resigned over his policies.

One newspaper editor was quoted as calling Tyler a "poor, miserable, despised imbecile." In Tyler's own obituary, The New York Times called him "the most unpopular public man that had ever held any office in the United States." When Tyler died, then-President Abraham Lincoln did not follow through with the customs of issuing a national mourning proclamation and placing flags at half-staff. </div>
<div class="large-3 small-12" style="background-color: #4169E1"> Perhaps the least-known president of consequence, James K. Polk kept his promise to serve only one term as president. Through various means, Polk acquired a huge amount of land during his four-year term. That land would eventually become all or parts of the states of California, Oregon, Washington, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, Nevada, Oklahoma, Colorado, Wyoming, and more.

Polk was a sickly child, having undergone surgery to remove kidney stones when he was a teenager. At the time, there was no antiseptic or anything to numb the pain.

Polk also was described as "boring" by some, pointing to the fact he banned dancing, alcohol, and card playing in the White House. </div>

<div class="large-3 small-12" style="background-color: #40B5AD"> SPECIAL FEATURE!!!! JFK MADE IT IN Much is known about the last president to be assassinated, John F. Kennedy, Jr.

Kennedy grew up in a wealthy family, and like all of his siblings, was gifted with $1 million on his 21st birthday. That's $20 million in 2022 dollars.

Kennedy also was a journalist for the last few weeks of WWII after being injured and honorably discharged from military service.

One last fact, no one knows what happened to JFK's brain after his assassination. It was stored at the National Archives but has since gone missing, leading to many conspiracies surrounding the issue> </div>

<div class="grid-x">
	<div class="large-3 medium-4 small-12" style="background-color: #6F8FAF"> We use the term "first lady" to describe the president's spouse because of Zachary Taylor. While memorialized Dolley Madison, saying, "She will never be forgotten because she was truly our first lady for a half-century." Before Taylor, the first lady was called "presidentress."

Taylor became the second president to die in office. While celebrating Independence Day in Washington, D.C., Taylor ate a large bowl of cherries and washed it down with iced milk. Bacteria in the milk or cherries caused Taylor to become ill, leading to his death #gotmilk? </div>
<div class="large-3 medium-4 small-12" style="background-color: #96DED1;"> Starting with Millard Fillmore and until Abraham Lincoln, the next presidents are considered some of the nation's worst, each making decisions that escalated tensions leading to the Civil War.

Fillmore wasn't known for much other than being considered "handsome" and for marrying his schoolteacher. Queen Victoria of England is rumored to have said Fillmore was the "handsomest" man she had ever seen. </div>
<div class="large-2 medium-4 small-12" style="background-color: #4682B4"> BADDIE BADDIE SHOT O'CLOCK! Like Fillmore before him and James Buchanan after, Franklin Pierce is one of the nation's least-known presidents. He is also considered by many historians as one of the worst.

Right after the election, Pierce's 11-year-old son was killed in a freak accident when a moving train hit the boy with some wood. Because of this, Pierce refused to take the oath of office by placing his hand on the Bible. He believed the death of his son was God's punishment for his campaigning for president </div>
<div class="large-2 mall-12" style="background-color: #0096FF;"> America's first and only bachelor president may have been the nation's first gay president, based on contemporary evidence, writings, and speculation.

Buchanan had a well-known close relationship with Alabama Senator William Rufus King. The two lived together for more than a decade, despite each being wealthy enough to own their own homes. King left to go to France in 1844, to which Buchanan is reported to have said, "I am now ‘solitary and alone,’ having no companion in the house with me. I have gone a wooing several gentlemen, but have not succeeded with any one of them.”

Buchanan is widely considered to be one of the worst if not the worst president in history. His actions, and lack thereof, led to the outbreak of the Civil War. Buchanan was also known to purchase freed slaves only to reintroduce them back into slavery or indentured servitude. </div>

<div class="large-2 small-12" style="background-color: #F0FFFF"> Much has been written and said about Abraham Lincoln, considered by many to be one, if not the greatest president. One lesser-known fact is that Lincoln almost joined a trek with a group that later became infamous for cannibalism. In the winter of 1846-47, The Donner Party embarked on a westward trip to California from Springfield, Ill. The group became stranded in the Sierra Nevada mountains and famously resorted to cannibalism to survive. Just 45 out of the original 89 people made it out alive. Lincoln almost became person No. 90 to go on that ill-fated trip, but his toddler and pregnant wife Mary Todd Lincoln were able to convince Lincoln not to go. </div>
