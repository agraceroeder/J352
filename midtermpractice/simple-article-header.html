<p>Disney's Magic Kingdom in Orlando has long been known as the most magical place on earth but fans and industry luminaries have warned that incoming changes could cast a dark spell on the historic theme park.
<br><br>
Understanding the cause of their concern requires looking back to 1955 when Walt Disney himself swung open the doors to Disneyland which was built on a former orange grove in California. Amongst its opening day attractions was the Rivers of America, a network of waterways which were navigated by an old-fashioned paddle steamer and and featured scenes from the frontier era on their shores. Over the years, other forms of transport were added giving guests the option of traveling on smaller keel boats and canoes.
<br><br>
They all combined to create a setting that looked like it had come straight out of the <em> Adventures of Huckleberry Finn </em> and there's good reason for that. Disneyland broke new ground because, unlike the amusement parks of its era, its rides and attractions were integrated into immersive environments.
As Walt himself said, 
  <div class= "grid-x grid-padding-x">
  <div class="large-8 medium-8 small-6 cell">
    <q class="pull-quote">Disneyland will never be completed. It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world</q>
  </div>
</div>
</p>
<p>
and, testimony to this, in 1956 he themed an island in the middle of the river network to Finn's adventures. It is home to a network of caves complete with hidden treasure, a floating bridge formed from barrels, a fort, a shipwreck and a tree house.</p>
<p> In keeping with its theme, signs are scratched into driftwood and painted onto cave walls whilst the maps of the island look like they have been drawn on parchment paper. Called Tom Sawyer Island, it is accessible by rafts and still welcomes guests to this day.
<br>
<br>
Disneyland was an overnight success which led to a string of motels and restaurants springing up next door. Not only did they clash with the immaculate theming inside the park but some undercut Disney. A number of these satellite businesses were so successful they are still there to this day, including the wintry Alpine Inn motel which backs directly on to Disney's desert-themed land based on its computer-animated Cars movies.

<br>
Walt took steps to stop this trend repeating when he was developing his theme park outpost in Orlando in the 1960s. It is built on swamp land which Disney purchased using several shell companies with anonymous-sounding names such as Tomahawk Properties, M.T. Lott Co and Latin-American Development and Management Corp. If Disney had bought the land directly, the owners might have asked for more money safe in the knowledge that the buyer could afford it. In turn, this would have have made it more difficult for Disney to buy as much land as it did.
<br><br>
Instead, it got it for a good price and made the most of this by buying around 25,000 acres. The land was originally covered with swamps but is now prime real estate thanks to Disney’s four theme parks and two water parks sitting on the site. The first to debut was the Magic Kingdom in 1971 and its opening day attractions included an expanded Rivers of America along with Tom Sawyer Island and an iconic paddle steamer. Sadly Walt wasn't there to see it as he passed away five years earlier. His vision paid off for decades to come.
<br><br>
Disney owns so much land at Walt Disney World in Orlando that it can lock out competitors and can control the standards in the area around its parks there. As anyone who has visited the sprawling site knows, the fantasy environment doesn’t end when guests step out of the park gates. The resort is home to more than 25 hotels, compared to just three in California. In addition, there are three golf courses, a Mediterranean-themed youth sports complex and a shopping and dining district designed to look like an early 1900s town from central Florida. They are all connected by roads which run next to manicured grass verges with topiary trees scattered amongst the landscaping. The road signs are bespoke to Disney and even the fire station has an eye-catching artificial hose which wraps around the building and leads into a fountain.
<br><br>
It all contributes to what the Mouse refers to as the ‘Disney Bubble’ and it has been made possible thanks to Walt’s game-changing realization that the caliber of the area surrounding the parks is just as important as the attractions in them. It also explains why the parks only represent a small fraction of the overall land at Disney World with a great deal of it earmarked for conservation.
<br><br>
A total of 2,825 acres are reportedly suitable for development with a further 2,256 acres described as being marginally suitable. It is one of the reasons why Disney's chief executive Bob Iger said last year that “we have thousands of acres of lands to develop, we could actually build seven new full lands if we wanted to around the world.”

It reflects comments from Walt when he introduced his plans for Disney World on television in the 1960s and said "here in Florida we have something special which we never enjoyed at Disneyland – a blessing of size. There’s enough land here to hold all of the ideas and plans we could possibly imagine." Little did he know that his words would come back to haunt Disney's management six decades later.</p>
